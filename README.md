MB3-Upcoming
============

Chrome extension that displays the latest upcoming episodes in Media Browser.

This extension has been created to provide a more convenient way to display your upcoming shows in Media Browser v3.

It will let you know when the content is made available in Media Browser and if you've watched the episode. In addition, you have the option to hide watched episodes to keep your upcoming list shorter.
